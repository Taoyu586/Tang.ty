## Reflections

One of the challenges I really struggled with was Vault. It was a side channel challenge where you parse the password through the response time. I was initially on the correct track but assumed that I was parsing the flag, instead I was supposed to parse the password to login and retrieve the flag leading to frustrating and confusing dead end. I learned that I should take a break and come back with a fresh perspective.
