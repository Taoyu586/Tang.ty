## Overview

K17 CTF was a ctf competition hosted by UNSW and was free to participate online. Trying to gain more experience I joined the competition expecting to get rolled. Overall extremely fun and doable challenges with unique solutions. 

## Challenges Solved

-el camel
-discord
-pass me the salt
-dinner
-janus
-smoothie
-daily re
-radioactive
-sanity check

### Daily Re
A wordle challenge that has all the words hard coded on the website source code. Requiring python scripting skills to parse it instead of manually checking. Flag was the 72nd, 73rd and 74th day word

### Janus
A DNS Rebinding Challenge that required the player to pass initial validation check then swap to local server performing a SSRF(Server Side Request Forgery) attack. 

## Highlights

- Solving Janus
- Placing top 120 amongst over 900 teams

## Reflections

One of the challenges I really struggled with was Vault. It was one of the challenges and was essentially a side channel challenge where you parse the password through the response time. I was initially on the correct track but assumed that I was parsing the flag instead of the password to login and retrieve the flag leading to frustrating and confusing dead end. I learned that I should take a break and come back with a fresh perspective.
